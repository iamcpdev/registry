            <Text>
              Use of convalescent plasma has been studied in outbreaks of other
              respiratory infections, including the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza
              virus pandemic, 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, and the 2012 MERS-CoV
              epidemic. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been
              shown to be effective in every disease studied. There are clinical
              trials ongoing to test if convalescent plasma from donors is
              effective at reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections.{" "}

              If you are someone who had been tested previously positive for
              COVID-19 infection and have recovered completely, you may be able
              to help those that are infected. Currently there are no medicines
              or vaccines approved against the COVID-19 infection. Several drugs
              and vaccine trials are ongoing. We are creating a registry of
              COVID-19 recovered community. All personal data will be
              deidentified. Hospitals and people around the world can access
              only the relative location of such recovered person and can
              contact you for plasma donation or for community help. This is
              because since you are immune, you can help people who are
              recovering, or in public areas!

              No. Only your relative location â€“ city, state and country will be
              shared. Each hospital will search the database for their location
              and can send requests to individuals in that city for request as a
              plasma donor. Only when you accept the request, you will be able
              to liaise directly with the hospital or clinic.

            <Text>
              No, it's not. Plasma can differ in the kinds and amounts of
              antibodies it contains. If a donor has specific antibodies in
              sufficient quantities, he or she may be considered a special
              donor. People may also have unique blood types that make them
              special donors as well.

            <Text>
              Donating plasma is a low-risk procedure with minimal or no adverse
              effects. Before donating, you'll receive information and
              instruction on the plasmapheresis process from plasma donation
              center. They will discuss the risks of adverse reactions, injuries
              and events that may occur during or after plasma donation, and
              they will give you the opportunity to ask any questions you may
              have.
